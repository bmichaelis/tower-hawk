/ returns if the app is up and responding with some basic stats maybe
/check runs the entire health check tree
/check/app/app1 runs the health check for app app1
/check/app/app1/alias runs the health check for the alias under app1
/check/tag/tag1 runs health checks for any commands with tag1
/check/app/app1/tag/tag1 runs the health checks for any commands with tag1 in app1
/check/priority/1 runs the health checks for any commands with priority 1
*/info returns info on the check rather than on the check run
post to /refresh refreshes the definitions
post to */restarting tells the app to only start alerting once checks have cleared

eventually, machine learning on outputs or combined alerts should be able to predict alerts that are going to come up and take steps to avoid issues
Some alerts should have commands that can be run to fix any issues that may be happening.
